Tldr - Quick hands on to write a simple flask based one liner app and Dpeloyment to APP Engine.

This is a Very Simple Flask application deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using **App Engine Standard.**
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a clean, minimal setup for:

Writing a basic Flask app
Deploying it to GCP App Engine
Understanding the end-to-end flow from local development → cloud deployment

Nothing fancy. Just something that works and is easy to reason about!
